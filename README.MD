# scrap_and_sleep

Hi there! Glad you made it here early. ðŸ˜Š

**scrap_and_sleep** is a Python library built with the idea of scraping social media accounts. After mentioning how I scraped Twitter, a lot of people asked me about it, so I decided to turn it into a library. This project also opens the door for improvements and contributions, especially for scraping other social media platforms.

### Current Status
Right now, I've just created the basic structureâ€”no code yet! But when I'm done, you'll be able to:
```
pip install scrap_and_sleep
```

### How You Can Help
For now, feel free to **star** and **watch** the repo. Iâ€™m open to collaborations and contributions, so donâ€™t hesitate to reach out if youâ€™re interested in helping!
